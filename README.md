# Customers-Segmentation-Basket-Analysis

In this project I'll be analyzing the dataset of different customers annual spending amounts for diverse product categories. The goal is to best describe the variation of different types of customers that a vendor interects with and how a vendor can improve the services which can help to boost up the revineue. 

### Data Source

The main data source is from Margarida G. M. S. Cardoso, margarida.cardoso '@' iscte.pt, ISCTE-IUL, Lisbon, Portugal, however it can be downloaded from Machine Learning Repository.

### Origional Data and Features's Relationship VS Log Transformed Data and Feature's Relationship

1. Non Scaled Data
* Grocery and Detergent show stronger correlation
* Grocery and Milk show slightly stronger correlation
* Detergent_paper and Milk show slightly stronger correlation

2. Logrithmic Scaled Data
* Grocery and Detergent show weeker correlation
* Grocery and Milk show stronger correlation
* Detergent_paper and Milk show slightly stronger correlation
